# Funplay

## Motivation
This was the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) after a seven hours hackathon at Laboratoria bootcamp. Working in squads of six students, the challenge was to create a music or entertainment app using an API. 
My team chose Youtube API and we made a game where the user elaborates a sequence of three questions and sends it to a friend. Based on the answers a video is displayed on the screen.
